# Elite 3D Engineering Portfolio

Premium React + Vite + Three.js portfolio for four role-specific views of the same profile, built around immersive profile homepages and data-driven case-study pages.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+ and npm.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the local URL printed by Vite

Useful commands:

- `npm run dev`: local development server on port `3000`
- `npm run lint`: TypeScript typecheck
- `npm run build`: production build
- `npm run build:pages`: production build for GitHub Pages, including static route entry points, `404.html`, and `.nojekyll`
- `npm run preview`: preview the built app

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This repo is configured for GitHub Pages user-site hosting at:

- `https://tanvisha28.github.io/`

Role-specific entry URLs:

- `https://tanvisha28.github.io/dataengineer`
- `https://tanvisha28.github.io/softwareengineer`
- `https://tanvisha28.github.io/datascientist`
- `https://tanvisha28.github.io/datanalyst`

Production builds use the root Vite base path `/`, and the app router uses the same runtime base. Public assets such as the profile image, resume, and optional audio files resolve through that base path so they continue to work from the user-site URL.

For GitHub Pages builds, use:

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run build:pages`

`build:pages` also creates `dist/404.html`, `dist/.nojekyll`, and static `index.html` entry points for every profile homepage plus every profile-scoped and legacy project route. That keeps direct GitHub Pages hits like `/dataengineer` and `/softwareengineer/project/lakehouse-platform` on a `200` path instead of relying only on the SPA `404` fallback. The repo publishes through GitHub Actions from `main` using `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Current Stack

- React 19
- Vite 6
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- React Router 7
- Framer Motion
- React Three Fiber + Drei + Postprocessing

## Project Structure

- [`src/pages/Home.tsx`](src/pages/Home.tsx): homepage with `Canvas`, `ScrollControls`, and HTML overlay sections
- [`src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`](src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx): profile-scoped project detail route
- [`src/components/3d`](src/components/3d): shared 3D scenes and effects
- [`src/components`](src/components): shared layout and section components
- [`src/data/portfolioData.ts`](src/data/portfolioData.ts): profile-aware source of truth for content

## Route Structure

- `/` redirects to `/dataengineer`
- `/:profileSlug` renders the active profile homepage
- `/:profileSlug/project/:id` renders the active profile's case-study page
- `/project/:id` remains as a legacy redirect to `/dataengineer/project/:id` when that project exists

## How The Homepage Works

Each profile homepage is intentionally not a conventional DOM page.

- A fixed full-screen `Canvas` renders the 3D story.
- Drei `ScrollControls` drive the camera movement.
- The visible text sections are rendered inside `<Scroll html>`.
- Total page height is measured to keep `ScrollControls.pages` aligned with the HTML content.

That coupling is the main source of both the experience quality and the repo's layout fragility. Treat homepage spacing work carefully.

## Verification Expectations

Minimum for any meaningful change:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

If the UI changed, also manually verify the affected profile homepages, profile-scoped hash navigation, and any affected project detail pages.

## Audio Setup

Place these files under `public/audio/`:

- `ambient-loop.mp3`
- `choir-hit.mp3`
- `hero-hum.mp3`
- `ui-click.mp3`
- `ui-hover.mp3`
- `section-sweep.mp3`

The cinematic sound layer lives in `src/audio/` and is wired through `SoundProvider`, `useSound`, and the central `soundRegistry`. Audio stays off by default, initializes lazily after opt-in, keeps ambient playback limited to the homepage, and uses IntersectionObserver-based triggers for major section beats and large reveal moments instead of raw scroll events.

To retune the system later, update `src/audio/soundConfig.ts` for per-sound volume, ambient fade timings, ducking levels, and cooldowns. The provider in `src/audio/SoundProvider.tsx` owns preference persistence, reduced-motion behavior, homepage soundscape activation, and visibility pause/resume handling.

## Notes On Environment And AI Studio Remnants

- `.env.example` still contains AI Studio/Gemini placeholders.
- `vite.config.ts` still injects `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- The visible portfolio currently does not call Gemini or an Express backend in the UI path.

Those remnants are safe to leave alone unless a task explicitly reintroduces productized AI features.
